## Abstract
The goal of our final project was to...

## What We Promised
### Must Have:
* A working license plate detection model for the camera that can store the individual letters/numbers.
* A script that compares the license plate numbers with a list of valid permits.

### Nice to Have:
* An automated route for the robot to follow using the GPS.
* An obstacle avoidance model using the LiDAR.

## Accomplishments
* We utilized the OAKD camera through the use of a license plate recognition CV model that was developed and posted on Roboflow.
  * We were able to detect the individual numbers/letters on the license plates and store them with about a 90% accuracy.
* We also created a script that compares the license plates with a database of license plates that have proper permits. 
  * It can then alert the user if the license plate does not match or if itâ€™s valid.
* We also created a quick GPS route that can work alongside the license plate detection system.
  * However we didn't have enough time to implement it into ROS2, so we had to run it on DonkeyCar.

## Challenges
* There were issues on how to get the license plate recognition model and the license plate comparison script onto ROS2.
  * The solution was to just create a ROS2 node that launches alongside the other ROS2 nodes, allowing us to just import our license plates script directly onto ROS2.
* There were also issues on getting the GPS to stay on its path accurately.
  * We were previously inside of the EBU2 courtyard, so the solution was to go away from any buildings in order to prevent the GPS signals from bouncing off the walls.
